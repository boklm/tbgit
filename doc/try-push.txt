tbgit try-push [OPTIONS]

Push topic branches to Mozilla Try server

  Push topic branches to Mozilla Try, and use git-notes to store the
  results URL, so that the try-results command can display results.

  The firefox and Tor Browser versions are determined from the currently
  checked out branch. If the checked out branch is a topic branch, only
  this branch will be pushed. If the checked out branch is a merge branch,
  all topic branches for the selected versions will be pushed.

  If a branch has a git note containing "notry=1" then it won't be
  pushed to Try. If the branch "$ffver/base" has a git note containing
  "notry_branch=$branch_name" then a branch of that name won't be pushed
  to Try.

  If a $ffversion/base.try branch exists, then the changes from this
  branch are added to every push to Try.

options:

 --yes          assume yes to all questions
 --list         don't submit anything, but list what branches should be submitted
 --max-push=<n> don't push more than n branches
