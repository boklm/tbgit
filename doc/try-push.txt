tbgit try-push [OPTIONS]

Push topic branches to Mozilla Try server

  Push topic branches to Mozilla Try, and use git-notes to store the
  results URL, so that the try-results command can display results.

  The firefox and Tor Browser versions are determined from the currently
  checked out branch.

  If a $ffversion/base.try branch exists, then the changes from this
  branch are added to every push to Try.

options:

 --yes          assume yes to all questions
 --list         don't submit anything, but list what branches should be submitted
 --max-push=<n> don't push more than n branches
