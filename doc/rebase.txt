tbgit rebase [--list] [--yes] <ffversion>
tbgit rebase --continue|--abort

Rebase branches on a new firefox release

  This command rebase feature branches on a new firefox version. Before
  running this command, you should be in the merge branch of the new
  firefox version and give as argument the old firefox version. The
  <ffver>/base branch for the new version should also already exist.

  Some branches contain the same commits and this command will try to
  only rebase them once. To do that, when a commit has been rebased,
  its new hash is stored using git notes in the the refs/notes/rebase
  branch. After beeing rebased, commits with a title that starts with
  "fixup!" are automatically squashed.

  The rebase process can fail require manual changes in two cases:

    * a patch cannot be applied on the new tree

    * a patch with a title starting with "fixup!" cannot be squashed

  In such cases, tbgit will exit and you can fix the issue and run
  "git cherry-pick --continue" (in case of patch that could not be
  applied) or "git rebase --continue" (in case of a squashing problem).
  After fixing the issue with "git cherry-pick" or "git rebase" you can
  run "tbgit rebase --continue" to record the hash of the rebased commit
  and restart the process. If you want to cancel the process you can also
  use "tbgit rebase --abort".

options:

 --yes       assume yes to all questions
 --list      list the branches that need to be rebased
 --continue  after fixing a conflict, restart the rebase
 --abort     abort the rebase process
