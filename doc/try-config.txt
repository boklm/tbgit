tbgit try-config --show|--edit|--remove|--add=<m> <commit>

Set or get Try configuration options on a commit

  This command sets or gets options on commits using git-notes stored
  in the refs/notes/try-push branch.

  The following options are usually set on the tip of a feature branch:

   pushid=<hg_hash>

     This option is automatically set by the try-push command after
     pushing a branch to Mozilla Try. The hg_hash is the identifier of
     the push, and is used by the try-results command to display the
     results and their URLs.

   notry=1

     When a commit should not be pushed to Try, this option should be
     set, and the try-push command will ignore it. See also the
     notry_branch option on <ffver>/base.

  The following options are usually set on the <ffver>/base branch:

    hg_hash=<hg_hash>

      This option defines the mercurial commit which corresponds to
      this commit. It is used when pushing branches to Try.

    notry_branch=<branch_name>

      When you don't want a branch to be pushed to Try, you can set the
      notry=1 option on its tip commit, but it is lost when a new commit
      is added to the branch. Or you can set the notry_branch=branch
      option on the <ffver>/base branch and the try-push command will
      ignore it.

    note_${branch}=<note>

      Where ${branch} is the name of a branch, this adds a note to be
      displayed for this branch by the try-results command. Multiple
      notes can be added for a branch.

   Example commands:

     $ tbgit try-config --show 38.2.0esr/base
     hg_hash=31bad6553933

     notry_branch=enable-browser.ini
     [...]
     $ tbgit try-config --add notry_branch=mingw-fixes 38.2.0esr/base

options:

 --show    show configuration for the selected commit
 --edit    edit the configuration in a text editor
 --remove  remove all configuration for the selected commit
 --add=<n> add some configuration on the selected commit
